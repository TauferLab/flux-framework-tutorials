# In Situ Benchmark Suite

This repo will contain a suite of benchmarks for in situ/in transit data movement tools (e.g., [DYAD](https://github.com/flux-framework/dyad), [DataSpaces](https://dataspaces.sci.utah.edu/)). Information about available benchmarks, build instructions, execution instructions, etc. will be added as it becomes available.
